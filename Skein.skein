The walls are gray and bare. In the middle of the room stands an old wooden table with a single chair. Hanging on the wall is an antique clock, its ticking echoing in your mind-strangely familiar yet distant. A vague memory lingers: the sensation of falling. This is something you will never forget, and the surname "Kr&#x0161;evean" echoes faintly in the distance, though you can't quite remember its significance. West is door and north is door&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a wooden table and an antique clock here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

You feel dizzy, and the air seems to buzz around you. The room has changed. It looks much tidier and cleaner now, as though someone has spent a long time organizing it. The once-bare walls are now spotless, and the table is neatly arranged with a small, mysterious object on it. The clock ticks more softly, almost as if it's calming you. You wonder if everything that just happened was real.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see Nona computer, a wooden table and an antique clock here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
